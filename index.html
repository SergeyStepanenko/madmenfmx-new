The team will now focus on maximizing flight time to collect valuable flight data, test component performance and validate design choices. All these data points will become important input for future iterations as we get closer to the commercially-ready UAV. Stay tuned for videos and further updates.</p></div></article><article><header><time class="date" datetime="2018-10-02">2 Oct 2018</time><h2 class="title">Luxaviation and Flugauto Set Up Joint VTOL Services Project</h2></header><img src="./images/blog_1.png" alt="luxaviation"/><div class="description"><p>Luxaviation has signed an MoU with Flugauto to help provide regulatory, safety, and training-management services to the VTOL startup company. Flugauto’s company vision includes development of the technology, operations, and infrastructure associated with its VTOL vehicle and its ability to deliver goods. Frank Noppel, CEO of Flugauto said: <i>“We are excited here at Flugauto to partner with Luxaviation, with their tremendous regulatory and operational experience, to bring our innovative VTOL technology to the European markets and disrupt the global logistics space”.</i></p><p>While discussions surrounding the VTOL market continue, Luxaviation noted existing hurdles within the industry. <i>“The VTOL business, which is changing the way we perceive logistics, mobility in general and specifically aviation, is technically advanced in hardware manufacturing and the development of applications, but the [VTOL] industry lacks knowledge and experience of regulations, pilot training, and safety quality management,” </i>said Luxaviation CEO Patrick Hansen. “Luxaviation can close this loophole with certified services, enabling Flugauto and the VTOL industry to provide a seamless and state-of-the-art service offer.”</p><p>Christophe Lapierre, Chief Commercial Officer of Luxaviation Group added: <i>“We are thrilled to contribute to the innovative VTOL market and help develop the evolution of the logistics, mobility and aviation worldwide. Entering the VTOL market and developing it as an additional business line of Luxaviation Group, after private jet and helicopter aircraft operations, is a logical consequence for Luxaviation as one of the largest private aircraft operators worldwide”.</i></p></div></article></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/main.1ac15163.js"></script></body></html>
